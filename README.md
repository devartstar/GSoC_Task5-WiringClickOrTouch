# GSoC_Task5-WiringClickOrTouch

On touching two adjacent Nodes they would get connected by wire. 
I am trying to avoid drag to make wires in touch devices because drag may conflict with moving the canvas.
We already have a simple Algorithm for Making Wires between ant two points in `circuitverse/simulator/node.js` file. 
Which also contains the code for connectors once the node is connected to wire end.
